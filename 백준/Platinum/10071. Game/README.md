### 문제 설명

<p>Jian-Jia is a young boy who loves playing games. When he is asked a question, he prefers playing games rather than answering directly. Jian-Jia met his friend Mei-Yu and told her about the flight network in Taiwan. There are <em>n</em> cities in Taiwan (numbered 0, ..., <em>n</em> - 1), some of which are connected by flights. Each flight connects two cities and can be taken in both directions.</p>

<p>Mei-Yu asked Jian-Jia whether it is possible to go between any two cities by plane (either directly or indirectly). Jian-Jia did not want to reveal the answer, but instead suggested to play a game. Mei-Yu can ask him questions of the form "Are cities <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> <strong>directly</strong> connected with a flight?", and Jian-Jia will answer such questions immediately. Mei-Yu will ask about every pair of cities exactly once, giving <em>r</em> = <em>n</em>(<em>n</em> - 1)/2 questions in total. Mei-Yu wins the game if, after obtaining the answers to the first <em>i</em> questions for some <em>i</em> < <em>r</em>, she can infer whether or not it is possible to travel between every pair of cities by flights (either directly or indirectly). Otherwise, that is, if she needs all <em>r</em> questions, then the winner is Jian-Jia.</p>

<p>In order for the game to be more fun for Jian-Jia, the friends agreed that he may forget about the real Taiwanese flight network, and invent the network as the game progresses, choosing his answers based on Mei-Yu's previous questions. Your task is to help Jian-Jia win the game, by deciding how he should answer the questions.</p>
